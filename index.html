            <h1><strong>Basics of Music Data</strong></h1>
            <br>
            <section id="Tasks">
                <h2>Identifying a Theme</h2>
                <p>The theme I've chose for this project is the Neoclassical metal genre. Neoclassical Metal is a sub-genre of heavy metal which, as the name suggests, focuses heavily on classical influenced melodies and sounds - especially those from the baroque period - infused with heavy metal.</p><br>
                
                <p>This genre is highly popular with guitarists and keyboardists, as the music in this genre generally has these two instruments at the forefront of the compositions, be it in the form of solos, or full-on vocal-less classical arrangements that can last for minutes in the middle of a seemingly "normally" arranged song. <code>(i.e intro -> verse A -> bridge B -> chorus C -> repeat A~C -> outro)</code></p><br>
                
                <br>
                
                <h2>Challenges with Music-Related Data</h2>
                <p>The internet has fortunately made access to music data such as sheet music much easier - be it obtaining physical printed versions of pieces, or digital of formats such as PDF - however that largely depends on how popular a piece of music or artist is to begin with. When it comes to more niche genres like Neoclassical, this is in my opinion, and from my own experience, the most prominent issue people may face - finding any sheet music at all. 99% of the time anything you will find has been made by the fan community. An example of this is the piece of music I used for the week 2 lab. I decided to transcribe the entire intro section of the piece, with all band elements present, as it didn't exist on MuseScore.</p><br>
                
                <p>Which leads me to another issue people may face - incorrect metadata. When you think of how many tracks currently exist, and how many new tracks that will some day exist in the future - you could argue there are/will be an infinite amount of pieces of music (provided humanity will always/hopefully continue to create)... therefore it's obvious the same title for a track has already been used/will continue to be used by thousands of other artists.</p><br>
                
                <p>There are 3 transcriptions on MuseScore (4 including mine) of the piece of music I chose to transcribe. 2 fan transcriptions which only contained a single instrument/element, which are correctly attributed to the artist. And then a 3rd transcription, from ironically the largest "official" sheet music provider to my knowledge, who attributed their transcription to the wrong artist. The title of their transcription reads Symphony X, who is the correct artist, but their sheet music clearly states "by PAUL CARDALL", which is the correct artist of the music they've transcribed.</p><br>
                
                <p>In regards to how this data is presented, if we're talking about the music itself, this can be found on most streaming services, or through sites such as Discogs which have excellent marketplaces for lots of hard to find releases. For sheet music and tabs, most available online are fan creations, however for the band I transcribed, there are 3 guitar tab books currently available for purchase which are official and from their more recent releases.</p><br>
